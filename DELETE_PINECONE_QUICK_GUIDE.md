# 🧹 Quick Guide: Delete Pinecone Data for Fresh Start

## TL;DR

**Answer: YES, delete everything for a fresh start with Firebase authentication.**

## Why?

- ✅ Just added Firebase authentication
- ✅ Old data has test user ID ("anoop123")
- ✅ New data will use real Firebase UIDs
- ✅ You're in development (no real users)
- ✅ Clean slate = easier debugging

## How to Delete (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Run the Deletion Script

```powershell
# In PowerShell, from your project root:
cd Server
npx ts-node delete-all-pinecone-data.ts
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🧹 Starting Pinecone data cleanup...
📊 Index: nubiq-ai-memory
📈 Found X vector(s) in the index
🗑️  Deleting all vectors...
✅ Deletion complete!
🎉 SUCCESS! Your Pinecone index is now completely clean!
```

### Step 2: Restart & Test

```powershell
# Restart your server
npm start
```

Then:
1. Open your app
2. Sign in with Google
3. Create a chat
4. Send messages
5. Sign out (saves to Pinecone with real Firebase UID)
6. Sign back in (loads from Pinecone)
7. ✅ Verify data loads correctly!

## What Gets Deleted?

### ❌ Deleted from Pinecone:
- All test conversations
- All user profiles
- All vector embeddings
- Everything in the cloud

### ✅ NOT Deleted:
- Your code
- Configuration files
- LocalStorage data (stays in browser)
- Firebase authentication setup

## What Happens After?

### First Sign-In:
- Empty slate, no history
- Create new chats with real Firebase UID
- Data auto-saves properly

### Next Sign-In (Same Device):
- Loads instantly from localStorage
- Real Firebase UID in all data
- Cross-device sync works correctly
