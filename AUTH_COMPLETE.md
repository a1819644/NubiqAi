## 🔧 Next Steps to Test

### 1. Restart Your Development Server

**IMPORTANT:** You MUST restart your dev server for the new `.env` file to take effect!

```powershell
# In your frontend terminal:
# Press Ctrl+C to stop the current server
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

### 2. Verify Google Sign-In is Enabled in Firebase

Go to your Firebase Console and verify:
1. Visit: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/vectorslabai/authentication/providers
2. Check that **Google** provider shows **"Enabled"** status
3. If not enabled:
   - Click on Google provider
   - Toggle **Enable**
   - Select support email
   - Click **Save**

### 3. Test Authentication

1. Open your app (usually `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:5173`)
2. Click the **"Sign In"** button in the header
3. AuthDialog should appear with **"Continue with Google"** button
4. Click the Google button
5. Select your Google account
6. You should be signed in! 🎉

### 4. Verify It's Working

Check these indicators:
- ✅ Your name appears in the header
- ✅ Profile picture shows (if available)
- ✅ Browser console shows no Firebase errors
- ✅ Backend logs show: `✅ Auto-created profile for [your-user-id]`
- ✅ AI greets you by name in the chat!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Google sign-in popup doesn't appear:

1. **Check browser console** for errors:
   - Press F12 to open DevTools
   - Look at the Console tab
   - Common errors and solutions below

2. **"Firebase: Error (auth/invalid-api-key)"**
   - Problem: API key is wrong
   - Solution: Double-check `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY` in `.env`

3. **"Firebase: Error (auth/unauthorized-domain)"**
   - Problem: Domain not authorized
   - Solution: Go to Firebase Console > Authentication > Settings > Authorized domains
   - Make sure `localhost` is listed (should be by default)

4. **"Firebase: Error (auth/operation-not-allowed)"**
   - Problem: Google sign-in not enabled
   - Solution: Enable Google provider in Firebase Console (see Step 2 above)

5. **Changes not reflecting**
   - Problem: Server not restarted
   - Solution: Stop server (Ctrl+C) and restart with `npm run dev`

### Backend not receiving user ID:

Check that:
- User is authenticated (check header shows your name)
- Browser console shows the user object with `id` property
- Backend logs show incoming requests with `userId`
