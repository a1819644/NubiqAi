## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Real Streaming (New Response)
```
1. Open http://localhost:3001
2. Sign in with Google
3. Send: "explain react hooks in detail"
4. Watch for:
   ✓ "✨ Streaming..." indicator appears
   ✓ Text appears word-by-word (not all at once)
   ✓ Smooth animation
   ✓ Total ~10-15s but feels instant
```

### Test 2: Cached Streaming
```
1. Send SAME question: "explain react hooks in detail"
2. Watch for:
   ✓ Still streams (from cache)
   ✓ Completes in 1-2 seconds
   ✓ Looks identical to real streaming
   ✓ "✨ Streaming..." indicator shows
```

### Test 3: Stop Button
```
1. Send: "write a 2000 word essay about artificial intelligence"
2. Wait 2 seconds (text starts appearing)
3. Click STOP button
4. Watch for:
   ✓ Streaming stops immediately
   ✓ Partial text remains visible
   ✓ No error toast (clean stop)
   ✓ Can send new message immediately
```

### Test 4: Long Response
```
1. Send: "explain all react hooks with examples"
2. Watch for:
   ✓ Continuous streaming (no pauses)
   ✓ Smooth scrolling
   ✓ No UI glitches
   ✓ Complete response arrives
```

### Test 5: Error Handling
```
1. Stop backend server (Ctrl+C in Server terminal)
2. Send: "hello"
3. Watch for:
   ✓ Error message appears in chat
   ✓ "✨ Streaming..." disappears
   ✓ UI remains stable
   ✓ Can retry after restarting server
```

### Test 6: Image Request (Non-Streaming)
```
1. Send: "generate an image of a sunset over mountains"
2. Watch for:
   ✓ Traditional loading (no streaming)
   ✓ Image appears after completion
   ✓ Works same as before Phase 3
```

## 📊 Expected Results

### Visual Flow

**Before Streaming:**
```
[Send message]
    ⏰ ...waiting...
    ⏰ ...waiting...
    ⏰ ...waiting...
[Full response appears at once]
```

**With Streaming:**
```
[Send message]
    💬 "## React"
    💬 "## React Hooks"
    💬 "## React Hooks are a way to"
    💬 "...use state and lifecycle features"
    💬 "...in functional components"
[Text builds progressively]
```

### Console Logs to Watch

**Backend (Server terminal):**
```
🌊 Streaming mode activated for text request
✅ Using cached response (streaming from cache)
✅ Streaming complete in 1.2s
```

**Frontend (Browser console):**
```
💡 Optimized context: Sending 3 recent messages + summary of 0 older messages
✅ Streaming complete in 1.2s (cached)
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Text appears all at once (not streaming)
**Solution:** Check browser Network tab, ensure `Content-Type: text/event-stream`

### Issue: "CORS error" in console
**Solution:** Ensure backend is running on port 8000, CORS configured correctly

### Issue: Stop button doesn't work
**Solution:** Check `abortControllerRef` is set before calling API

### Issue: Cached response doesn't stream
**Solution:** Check backend is chunking cached responses (50 chars per chunk)

### Issue: Multiple messages stream at once
**Solution:** Check `targetChatId` is captured correctly to prevent race conditions
