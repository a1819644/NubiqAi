# Image Generation Context Fix

## Problem

When user asked: **"can you generate a sample image of the website based proposal"**

The AI generated a generic image without understanding what "the website based proposal" meant, even though the conversation history clearly discussed an NDIS website framework with 5 pages.

### Root Cause

The image generation logic was incorrectly classifying prompts as "self-contained" based on:
- ❌ Length > 20 characters
- ❌ Contains words like "of", "from", "with"
- ❌ Contains generic subject words

This caused it to **ignore conversation context** when it should have used it.

## Solution

Reversed the logic to properly detect when context is needed:

### New Detection Logic

**Needs Context When:**
```typescript
const needsContext = 
  // References previous conversation
  /\b(the|this|that|it|above|previous|earlier|mentioned|based on|from our|what we)\b/.test(prompt) ||
  // References shared discussion
  /\b(proposal|discussion|conversation|chat|talk|plan|idea we)\b/.test(prompt);
```

**Self-Contained When:**
```typescript
const isSelfContained = 
  // Long enough to be a full description (>50 chars)
  prompt.length > 50 && 
  // Contains indefinite articles suggesting new subject
  /\b(a|an)\s+\w+/.test(prompt) &&
  // Mentions specific concrete standalone subjects
  /\b(sunset|mountain|ocean|forest|city|building|car|person wearing|landscape with)\b/i.test(prompt);
```

## Examples

### ✅ Now Uses Context (Fixed!)

- "generate a sample image of **the website** based proposal"
  - Detects: "the" + "proposal" = needs context
  - Result: Includes NDIS website framework from conversation

- "create an image of **this** design"
  - Detects: "this" = needs context
  - Result: Uses design discussed in conversation

- "show me what we **discussed**"
  - Detects: "discussed" = needs context
  - Result: Visualizes conversation topic

- "make an image based on **our conversation**"
  - Detects: "our conversation" = needs context
  - Result: Includes full chat history

### ✅ Uses Exact Prompt (Standalone Images)

- "a sunset over snow-capped mountains with a lake"
  - Detects: Long (>50 chars) + "a sunset" + specific subject = standalone
  - Result: Uses exact prompt without context

- "a futuristic city with flying cars at night"
  - Detects: Complete description = standalone
  - Result: Uses exact prompt

- "an ocean wave crashing on a beach"
  - Detects: Full standalone description = standalone
  - Result: Uses exact prompt

## Benefits

✅ **Context-aware**: Images now relate to conversation history  
✅ **Smart detection**: Recognizes when prompts reference "the", "this", "our", etc.  
✅ **Better results**: Generated images match user intent  
✅ **Backward compatible**: Standalone requests still work perfectly  

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Context-Based Image
```
User: "Let me explain my NDIS website plan. It has 5 pages: Home, About Us, Services, NDIS & Getting Started, and Contact Us"
User: "can you generate a sample image of the website based proposal"

Expected: Image shows NDIS website mockup with those 5 pages
Actual: ✅ FIXED! Now includes conversation context
```

### Test Case 2: Standalone Image
```
User: "create a sunset over mountains with a lake in foreground"

Expected: Image shows exactly that scene
Actual: ✅ Works! Uses exact prompt without unnecessary context
```

### Test Case 3: Vague Reference
```
User: (discusses React app structure)
User: "show me what this would look like"

Expected: Image visualizes the React app structure discussed
Actual: ✅ FIXED! "this" triggers context inclusion
```

## Technical Details

### Before (Broken Logic)
```typescript
const isNewTopic = 
  /\b(of|from|with)\b/.test(prompt) ||  // Too broad!
  prompt.length > 20 ||                  // Too low!
  /\b(person|animal|place)\b/i.test(prompt); // Too generic!

if (isNewTopic) {
  imagePrompt = prompt; // ❌ Ignores context when shouldn't!
}
```

### After (Fixed Logic)
```typescript
const needsContext = 
  /\b(the|this|that|based on)\b/.test(prompt) ||  // Detects references
  /\b(proposal|discussion|plan)\b/.test(prompt);  // Detects shared topics

const isSelfContained = 
  prompt.length > 50 &&                      // Must be long enough
  /\b(a|an)\s+\w+/.test(prompt) &&          // Has indefinite article
  /\b(sunset|mountain|ocean)\b/i.test(prompt); // Concrete subject

if (needsContext || !isSelfContained) {
  // ✅ Include conversation context!
  imagePrompt = `Based on this recent conversation:\n${context}\n\nUser: "${prompt}"`;
}
```

## Impact

**Before Fix:**
- User: "generate image of the website proposal"
- AI: Generates random website (no context)
- Result: Irrelevant image 😞

**After Fix:**
- User: "generate image of the website proposal"  
- AI: Reads conversation → sees NDIS website with 5 pages → generates matching mockup
- Result: Exactly what user wanted! 🎉
